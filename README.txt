A library built on top of the Panda3D game engine to support a computer camp for kids in grades 8 - 10. This library is based on Functional Reactive Programming. This library makes it easy to animate scenes and write simple games.

This project also includes the examples used at the camp as organized into short projects centered around topics in computer science, mathematics, and physics.
